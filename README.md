## Convesion between tetra-sexagesimal and decimal

This is similar to conversions between any number systems.
Our converter has two components: the JavaScript part that does the conversion and the HTML part that does the I/O.

## Different dialects

Firstly, you need to determine the suit ranking.
The ranking can be alphabetical (‚ô£Ô∏è, ‚ô¶Ô∏è, ‚ô•Ô∏è, ‚ô†Ô∏è), reversed-alphabetical (‚ô†Ô∏è, ‚ô•Ô∏è, ‚ô¶Ô∏è, ‚ô£Ô∏è), or alternating-colours (‚ô¶Ô∏è, ‚ô£Ô∏è, ‚ô•Ô∏è, ‚ô†Ô∏è).
Also, to some people, Ace is larger than K.
Our converter supports different dialects and can provide translation between them.
